# Product Requirements Document: Advanced Angular Application

## Project Overview
The project involves developing a production-ready Angular application demonstrating advanced front-end engineering practices with a focus on Angular Signals, TypeScript typing, and CRUD operations.

### Project Timeline
- Duration: 6 days (extensions available upon request)
- Deliverables: 
  - Source code in public GitHub repository
  - Cloud-hosted application
  - Setup documentation

### Technical Requirements
- Angular framework with Signals
- Strict TypeScript typing
- Mock server for CRUD operations
- Cloud hosting platform (AWS/Firebase/Azure)

## Core Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Requirements
- [x] Implement role-based access control service with TypeScript types
- [x] Create Angular Signals for tracking user roles
- [x] Develop custom structural directive (*acIf)
- [x] Support dynamic role-based UI rendering
- [x] Implement role change detection using Signals
- [x] Create standalone directive (optional bonus)

#### Technical Specifications
- Must use strict typing for role definitions
- Directive should support multiple roles
- Include fallback content for unauthorized access
- Reactive updates when roles change

### 2. Form Wizard

#### Requirements
- [x] Implement 3-step wizard interface
- [x] Create header with step indicator using Signals
- [x] Develop separate components for each step
- [x] Implement Reactive Forms with validation
- [x] Add inline error messages
- [x] Prevent invalid step navigation
- [x] Integrate mock server validation
- [x] Implement form progress tracking using Signals
- [x] Add final submission logging

#### Technical Specifications
- [x] Each step must be a separate component
- [x] Form validation must be client-side and server-side
- [x] Progress state must be managed via Signals
- [x] Optional: Implement asynchronous validators

### 3. Interactive Data Listing

#### Requirements
- [x] Create data table with sorting functionality
- [x] Implement multiple filter types:
  - [x] Text search
  - [x] Select dropdown
  - [x] Date picker
  - [ ] Checkbox
  - [ ] Radio buttons
- [x] Add pagination support
- [x] Implement preference persistence
- [x] Create CRUD operations:
  - [x] Add new rows
  - [x] Edit existing rows
  - [x] Delete rows with confirmation
- [x] Integrate RxJS operations
- [x] Use Signals for reactive state management

#### Technical Specifications
- Sort both ascending and descending
- Persist user preferences in local storage
- Implement proper error handling for CRUD operations
- Optimize data stream manipulation
- Balance usage of Signals and RxJS

## Mock Server Implementation

### Requirements
- [x] Set up mock server (json-server/in-memory-web-api/custom)
- [x] Implement REST endpoints for:
  - [x] Create operations
  - [x] Read operations
  - [x] Update operations
  - [x] Delete operations
- [x] Create server setup documentation

### Technical Specifications
- Must support all CRUD operations
- Include error handling
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Document API endpoints

## Quality Assurance Checklist

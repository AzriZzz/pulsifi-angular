# Product Requirements Document: Advanced Angular Application

## Project Overview
The project involves developing a production-ready Angular application demonstrating advanced front-end engineering practices with a focus on Angular Signals, TypeScript typing, and CRUD operations.

### Project Timeline
- Duration: 6 days (extensions available upon request)
- Deliverables: 
  - Source code in public GitHub repository
  - Cloud-hosted application
  - Setup documentation

### Technical Requirements
- Angular framework with Signals
- Strict TypeScript typing
- Mock server for CRUD operations
- Cloud hosting platform (AWS/Firebase/Azure)

## Core Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Requirements
- [ ] Implement role-based access control service with TypeScript types
- [ ] Create Angular Signals for tracking user roles
- [ ] Develop custom structural directive (*acIf)
- [ ] Support dynamic role-based UI rendering
- [ ] Implement role change detection using Signals
- [ ] Create standalone directive (optional bonus)

#### Technical Specifications
- Must use strict typing for role definitions
- Directive should support multiple roles
- Include fallback content for unauthorized access
- Reactive updates when roles change

### 2. Form Wizard

#### Requirements
- [ ] Implement 3-step wizard interface
- [ ] Create header with step indicator using Signals
- [ ] Develop separate components for each step
- [ ] Implement Reactive Forms with validation
- [ ] Add inline error messages
- [ ] Prevent invalid step navigation
- [ ] Integrate mock server validation
- [ ] Implement form progress tracking using Signals
- [ ] Add final submission logging

#### Technical Specifications
- Each step must be a separate component
- Form validation must be client-side and server-side
- Progress state must be managed via Signals
- Optional: Implement asynchronous validators

### 3. Interactive Data Listing

#### Requirements
- [ ] Create data table with sorting functionality
- [ ] Implement multiple filter types:
  - [ ] Text search
  - [ ] Select dropdown
  - [ ] Date picker
  - [ ] Checkbox
  - [ ] Radio buttons
- [ ] Add pagination support
- [ ] Implement preference persistence
- [ ] Create CRUD operations:
  - [ ] Add new rows
  - [ ] Edit existing rows
  - [ ] Delete rows with confirmation
- [ ] Integrate RxJS operations
- [ ] Use Signals for reactive state management

#### Technical Specifications
- Sort both ascending and descending
- Persist user preferences in local storage
- Implement proper error handling for CRUD operations
- Optimize data stream manipulation
- Balance usage of Signals and RxJS

## Mock Server Implementation

### Requirements
- [ ] Set up mock server (json-server/in-memory-web-api/custom)
- [ ] Implement REST endpoints for:
  - [ ] Create operations
  - [ ] Read operations
  - [ ] Update operations
  - [ ] Delete operations
- [ ] Create server setup documentation

### Technical Specifications
- Must support all CRUD operations
- Include error handling
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Document API endpoints

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follow KISS principle
- [ ] Implement DRY practices
- [ ] Adhere to SOLID principles

- [ ] Implement error handling

### TypeScript Implementation
- [ ] No use of 'any' type
- [ ] Proper interface definitions
- [ ] Type-safe Signal implementations
- [ ] Strict null checks
- [ ] Proper type guards where needed

### Angular Signals Usage
- [ ] Appropriate state management
- [ ] Reactive UI updates
- [ ] Integration with RxJS where needed
- [ ] Proper signal computation
- [ ] Effect handling

### Testing Requirements
